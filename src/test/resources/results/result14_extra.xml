I'll about,And drive away the vulgar from the streets:So do you too, where you perceive them thick.These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wingWill make him fly an ordinary pitch,Who else would soar above the view of menAnd keep us all in servile fearfulness.</speaker></detail><detail><act>ACT I</act><speaker>FLAVIUSBut wherefore art not in thy shop today?Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?</speaker></detail></result>
